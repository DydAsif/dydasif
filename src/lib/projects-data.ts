    description: "A client's Shopify store was failing to track purchase events accurately in Facebook Ads, leading to unreliable performance data. By implementing Meta Pixel and the Conversion API (CAPI) through Google Tag Manager with proper event deduplication, we achieved 100% purchase tracking accuracy and boosted the Event Match Quality (EMQ) score to 8.7/10.",
